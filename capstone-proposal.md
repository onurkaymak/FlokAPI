## Name of Student: Onur Kaymak

## Name of Project: Flok

### Project's Purpose or Goal: 

A car rental / fleet management system allows users to track the current status of the vehicle like if it is rented, in the cleaning process, or mechanic shop, and also information about the vehicle like VIN, make, model, color, and mileage. The application will have roles for different positions such as manager, customer service agent, auto detailer.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Add a vehicle into the fleet inventory with the provided information using authentication and authorization. 

* Set or track the current status of the vehicle, use roles for authorization.

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? 

#### Front End

* JavaScript
* React
* Node.js
* HTML5
* SCSS

#### Back End

* C#
* ASP.NET Core
* Entity Framework Core
* JSON Web Token (JWT)
* MySQL
* TiDB
* Docker

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here:

* Create two different front-ends, browser and mobile application.

* Create a barcode system that uses the devices' cameras to scan and set vehicle status from mobile devices.

* Deploy the project as a full stack application.

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

* React Native
* TiDB
* AWS
* Docker

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

For UI, I'm thinking to learn Tailwind but I'm planning to decide that when I start to work on the front end. My first priority is implement a problem free .NET Web API for the back end.
