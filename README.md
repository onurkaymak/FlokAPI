## üåê About the Project

### üìñ Description

*Flok* is a fleet management tool that is made for car rental companies. It allows users to create/track vehicles in the inventory, track production status, current detailing numbers, and information about current reservations. 

All the features work based on authentication and authorization, different employee roles have different access levels in the app. These roles are "Auto Detailer", "Customer Service Agent", and "Manager".

It's a full-stack application that is built on React with Redux & ASP.NET Web API with MySQL. While Flok works as a front-end that allows a dynamic and better user experience, Flok API (this repo) allows this tool to expand on mobile development with React Native (WIP).

## üèÅ Getting Started

### üìã Prerequisites

#### Install .NET Core
* On macOS Mojave or later
  * [Click here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.106-macos-x64-installer) to download the .NET Core SDK from Microsoft Corp for macOS.
* On Windows 10 x64 or later
  * [Click here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.203-windows-x64-installer) to download the 64-bit .NET Core SDK from Microsoft Corp for Windows.

#### Install dotnet script
 Enter the command ``dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script`` in Terminal for macOS or PowerShell for Windows.

#### Install dotnet-ef
For Entity Framework Core, we'll use a tool called dotnet-ef to reference the project's migrations and update our database accordingly. To install this tool globally, run the following command in your terminal:

```
$ dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0
```

#### Install MySQL Workbench
This project assumes you have MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench installed on your system. If you do not have these tools installed, follow along with the installation steps for the the necessary tools introduced in the series of lessons found here on [LearnHowToProgram](https://full-time.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql).

[Download and install the appropriate version of MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).

#### Install Postman
(Optional) [Download and install Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

#### Code Editor

  To view or edit the code, you will need a code editor or text editor. A popular open-source choice for a code editor is VisualStudio Code.

  1) Code Editor Download:
     * [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  2) Click the download most applicable to your OS and system.
  3) Wait for download to complete, then install -- Windows will run the setup exe and macOS will drag and drop into applications.
  4) Optionally, create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com)


### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Use

  #### Cloning

  1) Navigate to the [Flok API repository here](https://github.com/onurkaymak/FlokAPI).
  2) Click 'Clone or download' to reveal the HTTPS url ending with .git and the 'Download ZIP' option.
  3) Open up your system Terminal or GitBash, navigate to your desktop with the command: `cd Desktop`, or whichever location suits you best.
  4) Clone the repository to your desktop: `$ git clone https://github.com/onurkaymak/FlokAPI.git`
  5) Run the command `cd FlokAPI.Solution/FlokAPI` to enter into the project directory.
  6) View or Edit:
      * Code Editor - Run the command `code .` to open the project in VisualStudio Code for review and editing.
      * Text Editor - Open by double clicking on any of the files to open in a text editor.

  #### Download

  1) Navigate to the [Flok API repository here](https://github.com/onurkaymak/FlokAPI).
  2) Click 'Clone or download' to reveal the HTTPS url ending with .git and the 'Download ZIP' option.
  3) Click 'Download ZIP' and extract.
  4) Open by double clicking on any of the files to open in a text editor.


 #### AppSettings

  1) Create a new file in the FlokAPI directory named `appsettings.json`
  2) Add in the following code snippet to the new `appsettings.json` file:
  
  ```
{
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Warning"
        }
    },
    "AllowedHosts": "*",
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[DATABASE-NAME-HERE];uid=[YOUR-USERNAME-HERE];pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE];"
    },
    "JWT": {
        "ValidAudience": "example-audience",
        "ValidIssuer": "example-issuer",
        "Secret": "[YOUR-SECRET-HERE]"
  }
}
  ```

  3) Change the server, port, and user id as necessary. Replace `[YOUR-USERNAME-HERE]`, `[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE]` and `[DATABASE-NAME-HERE]` with your personal MySQL username, password (set at installation of MySQL) and your choice of database name. 
  4) To properly implement JSON Web Tokens for API authorization, replace `[YOUR-SECRET-HERE]` with your own personalized string.
     1) NOTE: The `Secret` is a special string that will be used to encode our JWTs, to make them unique to our application. Depending on what type of algorithm being used, the Secret string will need to be a certain length. **In this case, it needs to be at least 16 characters long**.
  

  #### Database
  1) Navigate to FlokAPI.Solution/FlokAPI directory using the MacOS Terminal or Windows Powershell (e.g. `cd Desktop/FlokAPI.Solution/FlokAPI`).
  2) Run the command `dotnet ef database update` to generate the database through Entity Framework Core.
  3) (Optional) To update the database with any changes to the code, run the command `dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationsName>` which will use Entity Framework Core's code-first principle to generate a database update. 
  4) After, run the previous command `dotnet ef database update` to update the database.

  #### Launch the API
  1) Navigate to ParksLookupAPI.Solution/ParksLookupAPI directory using the MacOS Terminal or Windows Powershell (e.g. `cd Desktop/FlokAPI.Solution/FlokAPI`).
  2) Run the command `dotnet run` to have access to the API.

## üõ∞Ô∏è API Documentation

Explore the API endpoints in Postman. Please note that, you will not be able to utilize authentication in a browser.

### Using the JSON Web Token
In order to be authorized to use the POST, PUT, DELETE functionality of the API, please authenticate yourself through Postman.

### Note on CORS
CORS is a W3C standard that allows a server to relax the same-origin policy. It is not a security feature, CORS relaxes security. It allows a server to explicitly allow some cross-origin requests while rejecting others. An API is not safer by allowing CORS. For more information or to see how CORS functions, see the Microsoft documentation. 

‚≠ê Please note that, this API allows CORS for development, you can run this API on your computer and make HTTP requests to this API.

#### API Endpoints

| Request  | Type | 
| :---: | :---: | 
| POST | /accounts/register |
| POST | /accounts/signIn |

```

### Fri, 12/08/2023
```
* 08:00 AM - Continuing to work on Fleet Controller.
* 08:07 AM - Trying to set authorization for the POST route in the controller.
* 08:16 AM - Reading ASP.NET documentation about role based authorization.
* 08:27 AM - Still working on role based authorization.
* 08:44 AM - Reading ASP.NET documentation "How to use Identity to secure a Web API backend for SPAs".
(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity-api-authorization?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
* 08:56 AM - Watching a video about roled based auth on Youtube.
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRVjIgr-WOU)
* 09:18 AM - WIP role based auth, still trying to make this work.
* 09:41 AM - Debugging role based auth, having really hard time with this. Everything works good without roles but when I try to reach to auth protected routes, I got 403 Forbidden error. When I read the decoded token, I can see the user role in the token but route doesn't accept this.
* 10:00 AM - Searching on internet about this role based auth problem.
* 10:39 AM - Finally I found the problem, It took good amount of time. I could just pass this bug and focus on controller and routes but role based auth is an important feature for my application so I wanted fix this before go further. Still need refactor my Account Controller because routes work with hard coded roles at the moment.
* 02:59 PM - I've realized I need three different user model for this application, we work with ApplicationUser class that extends from IdentityUser in the classes but I'm planning to add two more user model.
* 03:02 PM - Started to search about this three different user models idea, found some interesting content on Stackoverflow.
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64370175/how-to-add-multiple-identity-and-multiple-role-in-asp-net-core/64421573#64421573)
* 03:12 PM - WIP multiple users in IdentityUser.
(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1266674/how-can-i-have-multiple-identity-user-types-when-u)
* 4:18 PM - Trying to find a solution without multiple user class, maybe a simple join table can solve my problem?
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28667360/how-to-create-a-new-user-when-inheriting-from-identityuser)
* 8:05 PM - Working on a Join Entity, basically this join entity is going to be a record of the detailed fleet vehicles.
```
